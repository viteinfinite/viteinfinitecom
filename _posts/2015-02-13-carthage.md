Yesterday I talked about Carthage at CocoaHeads Paris. Here are the slides of my presentation, in French: <https://speakerdeck.com/viteinfinite/carthage>.

Even if I am not involved in the project, I believe Carthage has some great potential, I really like the minimalist approach and, in particular the fact that developers can keep control over what really happens when you add an external dependency.

The idea of using committed xcodeprojs to retrieve informations about the build is quite good, even if it obviously requires to have a shared scheme – which it’s not the case for the majority of project so far.

I’m looking forward to see more and more libraries supporting Carthage though even if for now, at least for client work, I’ll stick with CocoaPods.
