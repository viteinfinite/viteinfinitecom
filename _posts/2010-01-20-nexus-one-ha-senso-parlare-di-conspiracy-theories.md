    Leggo su Engadget che la presenza del supporto al multitouch sul Nexus One – fattore rilevante, seppur non fondamentale – sembra essere al centro di un intenso dibattito e dà adito ad alcuni curiosi dubbi.

      Of course, there’s always a chance that Google and Apple really do have some backroom deal that prevents Android from having native pinch-to-zoom in the US — Erick refused to explicitly deny such a deal when Josh asked him about <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/08/andy-rubin-on-multitouch-in-android-i-personally-dont-like-tw/">“conspiracy theories”</a> on the show. But that’s a hard pill to swallow. First, it puts Google at a huge competitive disadvantage from the get-go, which is a terrible business strategy for a company that’s pretty damn good at running its business. Second, Google <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2009/12/meaning-of-open.html">prides itself on transparency and openness</a>, and a secret deal forbidding Android from having pinch-to-zoom flies in the face of that culture. You say it’s a patent issue? Nothing’s changed since <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/04/some-more-perspective-on-the-droid-and-multitouch/">the last time I walked that lonely road</a>: I still have yet to see an Apple patent that covers the pinch-to-zoom gesture, and Palm, Microsoft, and a laundry list of other companies are all now using the move without consequence. Besides, it’s freaking <em>Google</em> — the same company that up and decided copyright law was broken and started <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/googlebooks">scanning out of print books</a> because it wanted to try something new. Even if there is some mythical Apple patent on pinch-to-zoom, Google is one of the few companies that has the financial and legal resources to get it invalidated — and there’s plenty of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=884017118027634444#">prior art</a> out there that’ll help it along the way.

    D’altronde, aggiungo, come si spiegherebbe la presenza del supporto multitouch nei Nexus One che saranno distribuiti in Europa?
