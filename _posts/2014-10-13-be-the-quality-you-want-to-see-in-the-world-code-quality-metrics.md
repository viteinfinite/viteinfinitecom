I somehow forgot to publish the slides on this blog. You can [get them here](https://speakerdeck.com/viteinfinite/be-the-quality-you-want-to-see-in-the-world-code-quality-metrics).

It’s been fun discussing with people about the subject. I think there is still a long way to go before having this integrated in the majority of the applicable projects, mostly because the setup process needs to be automated. Still, I believe it’s a step in the right direction.
