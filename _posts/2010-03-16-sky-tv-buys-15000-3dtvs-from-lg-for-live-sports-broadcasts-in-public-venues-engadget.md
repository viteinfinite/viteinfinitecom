      LG is today proudly boasting that it has sealed the biggest sale of 3D television sets so far, thanks to its partnership with UK broadcaster <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/skytv">BSkyB</a>. Following a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/01/inaugural-sky-3dtv-soccer-broadcast-received-warmly-hooligans-o/">surprisingly successful</a> trial run of broadcasting the Arsenal versus Man United match in 3D <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/28/3d-tv-coming-to-british-pubs-this-weekend-can-expect-chilly-rec/">this January</a>, Sky clearly sees its future through polarizing glasses and has ordered up the big batch of tubes so that it can provide weekly 3D broadcasts of Premier League games. The plan is for a rapid rollout this spring — which is right about now — meaning that your local pub should be getting all glitzed up just in time for the end of season excitement. It remains to be seen whether Brits will swarm to the new tech or lose interest once the novelty wears off, but judging from the size of this investment, it would seem the bigwigs in charge of our entertainment are already convinced that 3D will be a win.

    <strong>UPDATE</strong>: LG ha smentito la news in una successiva press conference. Il nuovo accordo stabilisce, in realtà, che SKY UK venderà 3DTV ai pubs mediante terze parti.
