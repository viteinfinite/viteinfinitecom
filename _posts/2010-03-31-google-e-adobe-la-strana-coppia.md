While HTML5 has been in development for years, content providers like the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/18/npr-and-wsj-building-flash-free-pages-for-ipad-apple-quietly/"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/18/npr-and-wsj-building-flash-free-pages-for-ipad-apple-quietly/"><em>NPR</em></a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/25/cbs-testing-html5-ipad-video-out-in-the-open/"><em>CBS</em></a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/29/ipad-roundup-new-york-times-and-more-get-html5-video-ipad-app/">more</a> have only begun transitioning video services to the new standard (and subsequently, away from Flash) now that it’s time for Cupertino’s big release. But this week, Adobe has found an ally in Google, which has just announced that the Chrome browser — and more importantly, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/chrome+os">Chrome OS</a> — will not merely support but natively integrate the technology. In the short run, what this means is that the Chrome browser won’t require you to download Adobe Flash Player or spend time updating it before back-to-back YouTube viewings and marathon Newgrounds sessions. In the long run, Google explains that it intends Flash to become an integral, seamless part of web design up there with HTML and Javascript — and if we extrapolate, an integral part of its new Chrome OS as well. Pardon us for thinking out loud, but it sounds like Google’s found an exclusive feature to highly tout, when it inevitably brings a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/02/google-mum-on-chrome-os-touch-support-chromium-devs-show-us-how/">Chrome OS tablet</a> to market. </div> </blockquote>
